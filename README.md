# container_of
This repository demonstrates the implementation of container_of and offsetof macros in C, which are essential for low-level memory management and pointer arithmetic. These macros allow you to retrieve the base address of a structure from a pointer to one of its members, which is useful in systems programming and data structures like linked lists.
